<h1 align="center">Lilia Framework</h1>

Welcome to **Lilia**, an advanced roleplay gamemode framework for Garry’s Mod.

## 🎓 Learning & Adaptation

Lilia is designed to **incentivize learning**—all of the source code is freely available so you can **study**, **modify**, and **adapt** it to fit your own needs. Feel free to explore how features are implemented, experiment with the architecture, and use Lilia as a learning tool to deepen your Garry’s Mod development skills. While using or distributing modified versions of Lilia is encouraged for educational purposes, **commercial resale is ethically discouraged**, though not strictly forbidden. Our goal is to foster a collaborative, knowledge-sharing community rather than a profit-driven marketplace.

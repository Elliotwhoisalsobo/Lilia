Welcome to **Lilia**, an advanced roleplay framework for Garryâ€™s Mod. Inspired by [Lillia from League of Legends](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lillia_19.jpg), the project aims to make creating a serious roleplay server as straightforward as possible. Lilia supplies a modular foundation with stable networking, intuitive UI systems and a rich API so server owners can focus on their setting rather than reinventing the wheel.
With plug-and-play modules for administration, door ownership, recognition, and more, Lilia scales from small personal servers to large communities. Because the entire project is open source under the GPL license, you can freely customize every aspect or build new plugins tailored to your setting.
